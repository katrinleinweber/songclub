				<strong>PHPNuke Installation</strong><br>
				<br>
				Installing Jinzora in standalone mode is by far the easiest installation.  We recommend
				that even if you're going to use Jinzora integrated into a CMS, that you start with standalone
				mode (although the integrated modes should work perfectly fine). 
				<br><br>
				...so if you're feeling brave continue on below!
				<br><br>
				<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0">

						<td width="40%" class="bodyBody" valign="top">
							<li><strong>Download</strong></li>
						</td>
						<td width="60%" class="bodyBody">
							Seems pretty simple, but it's worth stating.  First you've got to download Jinzora.  
							You can get Jinzora from the following<br><br>
							<a href="http://www.jinzora.org/modules.php?op=modload&name=Downloads&file=index" target="_blank">Jinzora Downloads Page</a>
							<br><br>
							We suggest that you create a "jinzora" directory to save your download to so you can extract it next

							<li><strong>Extracting</strong></li>
						</td>
						<td width="60%" class="bodyBody">
							Once you've got Jinzora downloaded you'll need to extract the download to your web server.
							<br><br>
							<strong>Windows:</strong> On Windows we recommend using <a href="http://www.winzip.com" target="_blank">Winzip</a> to extract the 
							downloaded .zip file (assuming that's the file you downloaded).
							<br><br>
							<strong>*NIX:</strong>  On *NIX you'll need to do a: tar -zxvf jinzora-X.X.tar.gz (where X.X is the version number)
							to extract Jinzora to the current directory (note: Jinzora will create a subdirectory called "jinzora")
							<br><br>
							<strong>NOTE:</strong> This directory MUST be located within the /modules directory of your PHPNuke installation

							<strong>Windows Users:</strong> You MUST make sure that the Jinzora directory from above is 
							located with in your webserver's root directory (c:\inetpub\www by default).  Virtual directories are
							NOT currently supported (support is planned for the future).  You can have your media on a different drive
							IF and ONLY IF you are using NTFS (see <a href="symlinking.html" target="Body">symlinking</a> in Using Jinzora)
							<br>
							You also need to make sure that the webserver has at least read access to the directory you've extracted
							Jinzora too (which it should unless you've changed things...)
							<br><br>
							<strong>*NIX Users:</strong> To make installing Jinzora on *NIX easier (and for those that have SSH access) 
							we've provided a script that will setup everything for Jinzora's installation.  Please simply run:<br><br>
							sh configure.sh
							<br><br>
							Inside the Jinzora directory.  This will create the necessary files and setup the proper permissions so the
							web based portion of the installation can complete (if you don't have SSH access don't worry, see <a href="ftp-only.html" target="Body">FTP Only</a>
							installation for assistance)

							To take advantage of the image resizing functions in Jinzora you'll need the <a href="http://www.boutell.com/gd/" target="_blank">Boutell.com GD image libraries</a>.
							To install these (these are ROUGH guidelines)
							<br><br>
							<strong>Windows Users:</strong> 
							<br>
							1. Download the GD Library <a href="http://www.jinzora.org/modules.php?op=modload&name=Downloads&file=index&req=viewdownload&cid=4" target="_blank">from us</a> (or get it on the net...)<br><br>
							2. Unzip it to the exact same directory where PHP is installed (c:\php)<br><br>
							3. Edit php.ini (usually in c:\winnt or c:\windows) and edit the following line:<br>
							   extension=php_gd2.dll (REMOVE the ; at the beginning of the line)
							<br><br>
							<strong>*NIX Users:</strong> This can be a bit more complicated on *NIX, so we recommend you view the installation guide
							located at <a href="http://www.boutell.com/gd/manual2.0.15.html" target="_blank">Boutell.com</a> for assistance

							Ok, now you'll need to create the links in your PHPNuke menu block so you can access Jinzora.  You don't have to do this,
							but most users will want to.  To add the link to the standard menu block:<br><br>
							In the PHPNuke Administration Screen<br>
							Go to "Administration"<br>
							Click on "Blocks"<br>
							Click on "View Blocks"<br>
							Click on "Edit" for the "Main Menu"<br>
							Add the following:<br>

							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;URL: "[jinzora]"<br>

							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Description: "Jinzora Music"<br>
							(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or whatever you want)<br>
							<br><br>
							Click "Commit Changes"

							Now you'll be taken through the web based installer.  The web based installer is fully documented and should
							describe each option that you'll have along the way.
							<br><br>At the very end the installer will create two files for you. The files settings.php and users.php will be
							generated, and if possible, be written to the server for you.  If the installer can't write these files you'll
							be able to download them manually.  You'll need to upload these 2 files to the root directory of the Jinzora
							installation.  Once you've uploaded these files you'll be able to go to the index page for Jinzora.
