				<strong>Media Players</strong><br>

				Jinzora has been tested with many different media players on many
				different OSes.  While we obviously can't test and support every media
				player, here is a list of the major ones we've tested with (using .M3U 
				playlist files)

						<td width="99%" class="bodyBody">
							Winamp 2.x and 3.x
							<br>
							This is our player of choice, mainly because it's pretty much
							the best media player ever written!  Also it supports extented playlists
							which look much prettier when you are streaming (as do others...)

				If you've used Jinzora with another player and know it works just fine
				please let us know and we'll add it to the list.  And if you know Jinzora
				has issues with your favorite media player, then use one of these! :-) Seriously
				if you know it has issues let us know and we'll try to figure them out!
