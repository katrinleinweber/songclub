				<strong>Symlinking</strong><br>
				<br>
				There are many times where you need to install Jinzora on one drive or partition, but all your media
				is on another.  There are a few options you have to get around this issue, mainly symlinking.
				<br><br>
				<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0">
					<tr>
						<td width="30%" class="bodyBody" valign="top">
							<strong>*NIX</strong>
						</td>
						<td width="70%" class="bodyBody">
							This is most definetly the easiest on *NIX systems.  If you're running *NIX you probably already
							know how to do this, but just in case you don't (hey, we all had to learn sometime, right?) here's how:
							<br><br>
							Say you have Jinzora installed in:
							<br><br>
							/var/www/html/jinzora
							<br><br>
							But your media is in
							/home/ross/music
							<br><br>
							You could then do a  (as one command)
							<br><br>
							cd /var/www/html/jinzora; ln -s /home/ross/music
							<br><br>
							To create a symlinked music directory inside Jinzora.  Then make sure to set your $media_dir = "/music"; and you're good to go!

							<strong>Windows</strong>
						</td>
						<td width="70%" class="bodyBody">
							This used to be basically impossible on Windows, but finally Microsoft has given us symlinking on Windows!  You'll need the
							linkd.exe tool (part of the Windows 2003 Resource Kit, <a href="http://www.jinzora.org/modules.php?op=modload&name=Downloads&file=index&req=viewdownload&cid=4">available here</a>)
							There are a few requirements for this to work, they are:
							<br><br>
							Windows 2003 Server or XP Pro (to install the Resource Kit to get linkd.exe)<br><br>
							ALL drives that are in play MUST be NTFS<br>
							<br>
							So as an example:<br>
							<br>
							Let's say your site is in:<br>
							c:\inetpub\wwwroot<br>
							<br>
							And your media is in:<br>
							d:\media<br>
							<br>
							Then the command would be:<br>
							linkd.exe c:\inetpub\wwwroot\media d:\media <br>
							<br>
							Then you're $media_dir in Jinzora would be:<br><br>
							$media_dir = "/media";
