				<strong>Premium Support</strong><br><br>
				Ok, so you've got an issue with Jinzora that you've just got to get resolved NOW and you don't
				have the time to play with it?  You're running Jinzora in a critical situation and need something
				added/changed/fixed as fast as possible.  This is why we have "Premium Support".  While Jinzora
				is totally Open Source software that we will NEVER charge for, and while we're happy to do all we
				can to help using our forums and documentation, if you just have to have it now we'll help.
				<br><br>
				There is only one thing we ask of our premium support users.  That you make some kind of 
				<a href="donations.html" target="Body">donation to the project</a>.  You can decided how much and what, but we ask for something in return for our
				specific efforts for you.  What we promise in return is that we'll pretty much drop everything - Jinzora
				related that is, we all have lives :-) - and do everything we can to either get you going, or to add
				that feature that you just must have. 
				<br><br>
				To obtain Premium Support please send us an email at <a href="mailto:ross@jinzora.org">ross@jinzora.org</a> and put
				Premium Support in the subject line, and set the priority of the email to high.  We'll contact you as fast as we can
				to get the process going.  Generally most issues will be resolved within 48 hours from initial contact.
