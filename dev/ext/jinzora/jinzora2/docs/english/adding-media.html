				<strong>Adding Media to Jinzora</strong>
				<br><br>
				You have many different choices for adding media to Jinzora, a few are:
				<br><br>
				<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0">
					<tr>
						<td width="30%" valign="top" class="bodyBody">
							<strong>Live Update / Rescanning media</strong>
						</td>
						<td width="70%" class="bodyBody">
							When adding media to Jinzora you must either have Live Update ($live_update) set to true 
							(it is set to true by default) or you must use the "System Tools" - "Rescan Media" tool so that
							Jinzora will see your new media and merge it into your database.  When using the "Add Media" tool
							this is taken care of for you.

					<tr>
						<td width="30%" valign="top" class="bodyBody">
							<strong>Upload Manager</strong>
						</td>
						<td width="70%" class="bodyBody">
							To add media choose "System Tools" - "Add Media".  This will open the upload manager 
							whic will let you upload entire
							albums through the web interface.  If you wish you can upload a single ZIP
							file (.tar.gz is not supported) and Jinzora will create the appropriate directories
							and un-zip the file for you, creating all the tracks.<br>
							<strong>NOTE:</strong> There are many issues that this brings up with the different
							web servers and the amount of data that can be uploaded to them.  This is not
							a 100% reliable system and should be tested in your enviornment before general use.

							<strong>FTP/SCP<br>SFTP/SMB/etc...</strong>
						</td>
						<td width="70%" class="bodyBody">
							There are many, many other ways that you could load media into Jinzora.  Remember that
							Jinzora simple reads the data within your $media_dir to find what it needs.  All you need
							to do is create files and folders within there and it will all be displayed by Jinzora.  You could
							use just about any method to do this, pick the one that's easiest for you!
