				<strong>Jinzora's Footer</strong>
				<br><br>
				You can change the contents of the footer in a few ways.  They are:
				<br><br>
				<strong>Turning off the Footer</strong> - You can completely turn off the footer if you wish by 
				editing "system.php" and changing the line to:
				<br><br>
				$show_jinzora_footer = false;
				<br><br>
				<strong>Footer Text</strong> - You can easily add text to the footer that will display on all
				pages.  This is done by creating a file called "footer.txt" or "footer.html" in the root directory
				of your media.  The contents of this file will be displayed on all pages (if a .html file then
				it is simply included so you can put it any code you wish).
				<br><br>
				<strong>Jinzora Logo</strong> - If you wish you may remove the Jinzora logo in the footer.  While
				we hope you'll leave it in so users will know what's powering your site, you are welcome to remove it.
				To do so simply edit "system.php" and change the line to:
				<br><br>
				$hide_pgm_name = true;
