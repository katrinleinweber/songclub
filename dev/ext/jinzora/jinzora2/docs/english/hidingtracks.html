				<strong>Hidding Tracks</strong>
				<br><br>
				Jinzora can "Hide" tracks when they are found in areas other than the album
				level.  When tracks are hidden a "Show Tracks" button will show just above
				the playlist bar at the bottom of the screen, like this:<br><br>
				<img src="images/hide-tracks.gif">
				<br><br>
				Clicking this button will reveal all the tracks that have been "hidden" from view,
				like this:<br><br>
				<img src="images/show-tracks.gif">
				<br><br>
				This feature can be very useful if you have a lot of tracks in random locations and you
				wish to hide them most of the time.  It will help keep your pages shorter and more
				navigatable.
