Introduction

	Jinzora is the premiere web based media management system.  It 
	allows you to easily stream your media, both audio and video
	from your webserver to virtualy any media player that supports
	streaming (WMP, Winamp, Foobar, XMMS, iTunes, etc).  


Requirements

	* php 4.2.0 or later (4.3.0 or later HIGHLY recommended)
	* MySQL 3.23.32 or later (not required but HIGHLY recommended)
	* Apache or IIS (other webserver may work but are not supported)

Installation

	STANDALONE INSTALLATION
	------------------------------------------------------------------
	To install Jinzora follow the steps below:

	1. Extract the download to you webserver, somewhere in your
	   webserver path.

	2. (in on Linux/Unix) Once extracted run "sh configure.sh" 
	   in the directory you extracted Jinzora to (this will set
	   the correct permissions for you - Windows users you do not
	   need to worry about this)

	3. Once extracted browse to the directory you extracted
	   the download and access index.php in your browser - this 
	   will take you to the Jinzora web based installer.  This 
	   installer will guide you through the rest of the setup 
	   and check all permissions and requirements of your system.

	4. The web based installer will create the Jinzora
	   settings files and user databases for you.  Once created
	   you'll be able to launch Jinzora directly from the installer

	5. Note on anonymous stats.  At the end of the Jinzora installer
	   you'll be asked about submitting anonymous usage stats. These
	   stats are truly anonymous, we do not collect any personal data
	   of any kind.  Please see the installer for details on what we
	   do collect.  Please consider submitting these stats to us,
	   they are very helpful in our development of Jinzora for the
	   future.


	CMS INSTALLATION - PHPNuke, Postnuke, CPGNuke, MDPro 
	(NOT MAMBO - see below)
	------------------------------------------------------------------
	To install Jinzora within a CMS follow the steps below:
	
	1. Extract the download to your webserver, making sure to place
	   it in your "modules" directory within your CMS path.

	2. Once extracted you MUST create the menu item within your CMS
	   BEFORE you begin the web install.  This is the most common
	   issue with CMS mode installs.

	3. Once you've created the menu item in your menu block (per
	   step 2) click on this menu block item to begin the web based
	   installer.  YOU MUST CLICK THIS LINK!  You can NOT just hit
	   index.php as in the standalone install.  THIS WILL NOT WORK!
	   The url you should be hitting should look something like:
	   /modules.php?name=jinzora (that is a PHPNuke example).
	   If you just hit index.php the installer will work but
	   Jinzora WILL NOT WORK after the installation.

	4. Once you begin the web based installer it will guide you 
	   through the rest of the setup and check all permissions and 
	   requirements of your system.

	5. Once the installer is complete it will create the Jinzora
	   settings files and user databases for you.  Once created
	   you'll be able to launch Jinzora directly from the installer

	6. Note on anonymous stats.  At the end of the Jinzora installer
	   you'll be asked about submitting anonymous usage stats. These
	   stats are truly anonymous, we do not collect any personal data
	   of any kind.  Please see the installer for details on what we
	   do collect.  Please consider submitting these stats to us,
	   they are very helpful in our development of Jinzora for the
	   future.



	CMS INSTALLATION - Mambo
	------------------------------------------------------------------
	To install Jinzora within Mambo follow the steps below:
	
	1. Extract the download to your local computer, NOT to the web
	   server.  Yes, this is different than a standard Mambo install
	   we hope to update this in the future.

	2. Once extracted you MUST create the menu item within Mambo
	   BEFORE you begin the web install.  This is the most common
	   issue with CMS mode installs.  To do this follow these steps:

	   - Click "Components - Install/Uninstall"
	   - In "Package File:" click "Browse" and select the .zip package 
	     that you downloaded
	   - Click "Upload File & Install"
	   - In the Mambo Administration page click on "Menu - Main Menu"
	   - Click on "New" (at the top of the page)
	   - Select "Component" and click "Next"
	   - For "Name" name your link "Jinzora" or whatever you want
	     For "Component" choose "Jinzora"
	     Click "Save"
	   - Now, you MUST extact the .zip or .tar.gz file that you downloaded 
             and upload it manually to the server. All the contents should be 
	     extracted to "components/com_jinzora". We realize this is odd, 
             and are working to make this better but this is just how it is for 
	     now, trust us when you get Jinzora working it will be worth it! 
	     (just overwrite everything that is there...)

	   - NOTE: At the end of install if you are using a very narrow theme, 
		   like "SolarFlare" then Jinzora will most likely display funny. 
		   This is due to the width of Jinzora and is NOT a bug. To make 
		   Jinzora display better consider turning off some of the drop 
		   down meune like the quick playlist generator by setting 
		   $quick_drop = "false"; in your settings.php file.

	   - Click the menu item for "Jinzora" (or whatever you called it) - 
	     You'll now be taken through the Jinzora installer

	3. Once the installer is complete it will create the Jinzora
	   settings files and user databases for you.  Once created
	   you'll be able to launch Jinzora directly from the installer

	4. Note on anonymous stats.  At the end of the Jinzora installer
	   you'll be asked about submitting anonymous usage stats. These
	   stats are truly anonymous, we do not collect any personal data
	   of any kind.  Please see the installer for details on what we
	   do collect.  Please consider submitting these stats to us,
	   they are very helpful in our development of Jinzora for the
	   future.



Upgrading from an older version of Jinzora

	Upgrading Jinzora is generally a very simple process.  Currently upgrades
	from Jinzora versions prior to 2.0 are not support.  If you are running a
	Jinzora 2.x release to upgrade simply download the package and replace all
	files in your current Jinzora installation with the new files.  When you reload
	the Jinzora home page you will be taken through the Jinzora installer
	if necessary and if possible you may simply upgrade your existing installation
	rather than needing a full re-install.  The installer has logic built in to
	know what it needs to do for you.  
	
	Incremental verision upgrades (2.3.2 to 2.3.3) do not require any intervention on your
	part.  Simply replace the files and you should be all set.  Minor and major
	version upgrades (2.2.x to 2.3.x or 2.2.x to 3.x when available) require
	going back through the installer and choosing "Upgrade".
