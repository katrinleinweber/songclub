				<strong>Lo-Fi Files</strong><br>
				<br>
				There may be times in which you'd like to present your user with "lo-fi" files.  These would be smaller, much lower
				quality files that a "lofi" user could stream (more on that later).  All you need to do is create a file with the lower
				encoding settings (say 32k for an MP3 vs 128k) and name it:
				<br><br>
				Track Name.lofi.mp3
				<br><br>
				And Jinzora will display the lofi icon for it.  If there is a file with the EXACT same name (other than the .lofi) it will be 
				displayed with the lofi file.
				<br><br>
				You can also set your default user permissions to "lofi" so that default users would only be able to stream the .lofi files.
				<br><br>
				<strong>Creating Lo-Fi Files</strong>
				<br>
				Jinzora can easily create Lo-Fi files for you.  To do this you'll need to have the LAME encoder installed on your machine. 
				You can get the LAME encoder at: <a href="http://lame.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">http://lame.sourceforge.net/</a>
				<br><br>
				To use the LAME encoder to create Lo-Fi files you'll need to edit "system.php" and make sure that:
				<br><br>
				$lame_opts = "/usr/local/bin/lame -a -b 32 --mp3input --resample 22.05 ";
				<br><br>
				Is set with the options you'd like, and that the path is correct. You can find details on what options are available on the
				LAME site at <a href="http://lame.sourceforge.net/USAGE" target="_blank">http://lame.sourceforge.net/USAGE</a>
				<br><br>
				Once you have "system.php" setup properly, all you need to do is (as an Admin user) click the Info "?" button next to a track.
				In this window you'll see the "Create Lo-Fi" button (if the permissions check out correctly), and if a Lo-Fi file exists
				you'll see the "Delete Lo-Fi" button, so you can clean them up if you wish.  Don't forget to rewrite the ID3 tags on the
				track after you've created it, as it will be blank at first.
