				One of the Groupware features of Jinzora is dicussions.  This allows users to
				to enter their own comments on any item in Jinzora (Genres/Artist/Albums/Tracks).
				Users can only comment once, based on either their logged in username or their
				IP Address.

							There are a few things you'll need to do to enable discussions.  You can choose the
							"workgroup" install type during installation, which will set the proper options, or make sure 
							that:<br><br>
							$enable_discussion = "true";
							<br><br>
							In your settings.php file.
							<br><br>
							You'll also need to make sure that you've created the "data" directory (under the 
							root directory of Jinzora) and that the webserver user has write access to this directory.
							This directory stores all the data files that are needed for discussions.
