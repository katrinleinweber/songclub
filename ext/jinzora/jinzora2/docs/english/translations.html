				<strong>Translations</strong><br>
				<br>
				Speak another language other than English?  Use one of our translations that sucks?  Please help us
				translate Jinzora into your native language and share that translations with others!<br><br>
				Helping us translate Jinzora should be very easy (we hope anyway).  The process is very simple, you just need
				to download our reference English file and translate away.  Once you've completed your translation please contact us
				at <a href="mailto:ross@jinzora.org">ross@jinzora.org</a> so we can add your translation to the project and
				credit you in the project.<br><br>
				The first place to start is with the reference language file.  You can access the most current version of it
				in our Web based CVS, at the link below.  Just click on the highest version number of it in the CVS, as that's the most
				current file.  We'll contact you for changes in the future (if that's ok...) so we can keep them up to date.
