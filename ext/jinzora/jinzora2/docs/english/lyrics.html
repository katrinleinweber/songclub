				Jinzora has several tools included to help you manage your lyrics.  You can use the
				"Media Management" - "Retrieve Lyrics" tool to automatically retrieve lyrics for all the media
				in your collection.

				You can also add specific lyrics by editing a single track using the track
				edit tool (? in most frontends).
