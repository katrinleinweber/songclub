				<strong>Random Album Art</strong><br>
				<br>
				Jinzora can display random album art from a random sampling of albums from your collection.  This can be displayed
				on the home page as well as the artist pages.  There are a few settings for
				random album display, they are:
				<br>
				<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>$random_albums</strong><br>
					This is the number of "slots" to put in the Random Album Section
				</li>
				<br><br>
				<li>
					<strong>$random_per_slot</strong><br>
					How many different albums should we cycle between in each "slot"
				</li>
				<br><br>
				<li>
					<strong>$random_rate</strong><br>
					How quickly should we rotate the images (in ms, so 1000 = 1 second)
				</li>
				<br><br>
				<li>
					<strong>$random_art_size</strong><br>
					The dimensions ("100x100") that the art should be display at.
				</li>
