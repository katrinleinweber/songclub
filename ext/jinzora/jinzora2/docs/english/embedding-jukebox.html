				<strong>Embedded Controls</strong><br>
				<br><br>
				When using the Jukebox features of Jinzora you may wish to embed the Jinzora Jukebox
				controls within another web based application.  We do this by embedding the Jukebox
				controls within a page that displays a slideshow of picutres on a small laptop in our
				kitchen.  In this way we can view the pictures and control Jinzora for one single page.
				This is done by using an iFrame as described below.
				<br><br>
				All that you need to do is reference the following file:
				<br><br>
				http://urltojinzora/path/to/jinzora/slim/slim.jukebox.html?direct=yes&c=current&bg=gray&fc=black&rf=30
				<br><br>
				<strong>Options</strong>
				<br><br>
				c = "current" or "control"
				<br>
				"current" will also show the currently playing track and the playback controls<br>
				"control" will only show the playback controls
				<br><br>
				bg = "background color" (either HEX or word)
				<br><br>
				fc = "font color" (either HEX or word)
				<br><br>
				rf = "refresh" - this sets the refresh time (in seconds) of the page
				<br><br>
				<strong>Using in an iFrame</strong>
				<br>
				To use these controls in an iFrame (which will seemlessly integrate into a page) use the following
				in your HTML
				<br><br>
				&lt;iframe name="slimzora" src="http://10.10.0.100/jinzora/slim/slim.jukebox.html?direct=yes&c=current&bg=gray&fc=black&rf=30" style="width: 500; border: 0px solid black;" height="45" frameborder="0">&lt;/iframe>
				<br><br>
				This is the code that the Jinzora author uses in his personal setup.  Copy, paste, and modify this as you wish!
