							<strong>Windows:</strong> On Windows we recommend using <a href="http://www.winzip.com" target="_blank">Winzip</a> to extract the 
							downloaded .zip file (assuming that's the file you downloaded).
							<br><br>
							<strong>*NIX:</strong>  On *NIX you'll need to do a: tar -zxvf jinzora-X.X.tar.gz (where X.X is the version number)
							to extract Jinzora to the current directory (note: Jinzora will create a subdirectory called "jinzora")
							<br><br>
							<strong>NOTE: This directory MUST be located within the /modules directory of your Nuke installation</strong>

							<strong>*NIX Users:</strong> To make installing Jinzora on *NIX easier (and for those that have SSH access) 
							we've provided a script that will setup everything for Jinzora's installation.  Please simply run:<br><br>
							sh configure.sh
							<br><br>
							Inside the Jinzora directory.  This will create the necessary files and setup the proper permissions so the
							web based portion of the installation can complete (if you don't have SSH access don't worry, see <a href="ftp-only.html" target="Body">FTP Only</a>

							To take advantage of the image resizing functions in Jinzora you'll need the <a href="http://www.boutell.com/gd/" target="_blank">Boutell.com GD image libraries</a>.
							To install these (these are ROUGH guidelines)
							<br><br>
							<strong>Windows Users:</strong> 
							<br>
							1. Download the GD Library <a href="http://www.jinzora.org/modules.php?op=modload&name=Downloads&file=index&req=viewdownload&cid=4" target="_blank">from us</a> (or get it on the net...)<br><br>
							2. Unzip it to the exact same directory where PHP is installed (c:\php)<br><br>
							3. Edit php.ini (usually in c:\winnt or c:\windows) and edit the following line:<br>
							   extension=php_gd2.dll (REMOVE the ; at the beginning of the line)
							<br><br>
							<strong>*NIX Users:</strong> This can be a bit more complicated on *NIX, so we recommend you view the installation guide
							located at <a href="http://www.boutell.com/gd/manual2.0.15.html" target="_blank">Boutell.com</a> for assistance

							Now you'll need to create the link for Jinzora in your menu block.  Each of the CMSes does this a bit differently, so
							please refer to your CMS on how to do this.  To be clear you CAN NOT just hit index.php to access Jinzora,
							you must access it in the way your CMS does.
							<br><br>
							Once you've added your link click on it and continue on...

							<br><br>
							Once the installation is complete if you want to make changes to Jinzora please do so by using the "Enter Setup" tool located
							on the Tools menu within Jinzora.  This will let you change every setting with Jinzora.
							<br><br>At the very end the installer you'll be given the option to submit anonymous stats about your
							Jinzora installation.  We hope you'll submit these stats so that we can do our best to make
							Jinzora as powerful as possible.  We do not collect any personal or user specific information
							of any kind at this step.
