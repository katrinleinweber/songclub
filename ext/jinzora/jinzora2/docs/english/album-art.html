				<strong>Album Art</strong>

				One of the more powerful features of Jinzora is it's ability to not only display
				but to help you obtain album art for your media.

							Jinzora can display alubm art for all the albums in your collection.
							There are two ways in which Jinzora can read your existing art:
							<br>
							<ul>
							<li>Filesystem based: Jinzora will read .jpg, .gif, or .png files
							from your filesystem when located in an "album" folder.  When Jinzora
							sees an image file in the directory with media it will use that as
							the image for that album</li><br>
							<li>ID3 Tags: </li>Jinzora can also read images that are embedded within
							the ID3 tags of your files.  Jinzora will use this method in the tag data
							importer, and as a fall back method when using the filesystem importer
							</ul>

										When you are viewing an album that does not have art you can click the link

										<strong>Auto Searching</strong>
										<br>
										If you enable it ($auto_search_art = "true"; in settings.php) Jinzora will automatically
										search for album art for albums when you view an artist.  Jinzora will download the first 
										match it finds for a particular album.  You can easily click the "Change Art" link below
										the album (or on the Track page) to select a different album cover for that album
										<br><br>
										NOTE: When Jinzora can not find a match on art it will create a template image with the
										name of the album dynamically generated on the image for you.

										<strong>Using the Admin Tool</strong>
										<br>
										If you wish, you can use the "Search for missing album art" tool on the Tools page in Jinzora
										to go through each album in your collection, one by one.  While this can be time consuming on
										a large collection, for smaller ones it can let you choose each album cover you want, one by one
										in a relatively quickly fashion
										<br><br>
										NOTE: When Jinzora can not find a match on art it will create a template image with the
										name of the album dynamically generated on the image for you.
