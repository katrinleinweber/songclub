				<strong>Securing Jinzora</strong><br>
				<br>
				There are many different ways in which you can secure Jinzora.  This should be thought of
				as more of a general guide rather than highly detailed specifics to securing Jinzora.<br><br>
				<strong>DISCLAIMER</strong> In NO WAY is the Jinzora Development Team responsible for the
				securing of your data!!!

							<strong>Jinzora Users</strong>
						</td>
						<td width="70%" class="bodyBody">
							The simplest way to secure Jinzora is to use different users with different access
							levels and to set Jinzora's default mode to "viewonly" (if appropriate).  There are 4
							levels of users, they are:<br><br>
							<strong>Admin:</strong> Just what you think this user type can do just about everything
							<br><br>
							<strong>Power User:</strong> Very similiar to an Admin, but they can't use the "Tools" section
							<br><br>
							<strong>User:</strong> A user can play music, but NOT download (only Power Users can)
							<br><br>
							<strong>View Only:</strong> Pretty obvious, don't you think?

							<strong>Securing<br>Apache</strong>
						</td>
						<td width="70%" class="bodyBody">
							Probably the best way to secure Jinzora for real is the use of .htaccess and .htpasswd files in
							Apache (user authentication).  Again this guide isn't the end all on security, so do some searching
							if you're not familiar with this concept.  One thing you'll want to do (possibly) is set:<br><br>
							$auth_value = "user:pass";
							<br><br>
							In settings.php  This value will be prepended to all playlist when Jinzora generates them so that
							you (and your users) won't have to worry about authentication issues with their favorite media player.

							<strong>Securing IIS</strong>
						</td>
						<td width="70%" class="bodyBody">
							Probably the best way to secure Jinzora on IIS is to enable Authentication (like Apache above).
							Again this guide isn't the end all on security, so do some searching
							if you're not familiar with this concept.  One thing you'll want to do (possibly) is set:<br><br>
							$auth_value = "user:pass";
							<br><br>
							In settings.php  This value will be prepended to all playlist when Jinzora generates them so that
							you (and your users) won't have to worry about authentication issues with their favorite media player.

						<td width="30%" class="bodyBody" valign="top">
							<strong>Preventing Right Clicks</strong>
						</td>
						<td width="70%" class="bodyBody">
							One way to secure your content is to disable the right mouse button.  This would make it much more difficult
							for users to be able to download your images and tracks.  It would prevent them from easily copying the HREFs
							to your media as well.<br><br>
							Realize that there is no 100% way to prevent a user from access this information.  They could always view the source
							HTML and get the data from there.  Also realize that using this feature will actually piss off some of your users
							as it will disable many other features of the browser (like opening links in new windows, etc). 
							<br><br>
							To enable this feature you'll need to set:<br><br>
							$secure_links = "true";<br><br>
							In system.php (NOT settings.php). <br>
							<strong>NOTE:</strong> This feature is NOT supported in upgrades.  You'll need to set this in system.php each time you
							upgrade Jinzora.
