				<strong>Excluding Items</strong>
				<br><br>
				In Jinzora you can "Exclude" or "Hide" Genres or Artists from view.  This does not
				delete the Genre or Artists, but rather just hides it from all view.
				This was added to help in multi-user enviornments.

							<strong>Per User</strong>
						</td>
						<td width="70%" class="bodyBody">
							Items can be excluded on a per-user basis.  So each user that is logged in 
							need only click the info button (generally a ?) next to the item they'd
							like to exclude and click "Exclude Genre (or Artist)".

						<td width="70%" class="bodyBody">
							Items can be globally excluded so they are hidden from all users.  This can be done 2 ways:
							<br><br>
							1. When logged in as admin (the acutal admin username)<br><br>
							2. By creating the file global-exclude.lst (to be located within the temp/ directory relative
							to Jinzora).  Any match in this file (it is case sensitive) will be excluded from view
