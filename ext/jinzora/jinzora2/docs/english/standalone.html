				<strong>Standalone Installation</strong><br>
				<br>
				Installing Jinzora in standalone mode is by far the easiest installation.  To install Jinzora
				in Standalone mode please follow these steps:
				<br><br>
				<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0">
					<tr>
						<td width="40%" class="bodyBody" valign="top">
							<li><strong>Download</strong></li>
						</td>
						<td width="60%" class="bodyBody">
							You can get Jinzora from the following<br><br>
							<a href="http://www.jinzora.com/download/" target="_blank">Jinzora Downloads Page</a>
							<br><br><br><br>
						</td>						
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td width="40%" class="bodyBody" valign="top">
							<li><strong>Extracting</strong></li>
						</td>
						<td width="60%" class="bodyBody">
							Once you've got Jinzora downloaded you'll need to extract the download to your web server.
							<br><br>
							<strong>Windows:</strong> On Windows we recommend using <a href="http://www.winzip.com" target="_blank">Winzip</a> 
							to extract the downloaded .zip file (assuming that's the file you downloaded).
							<br><br>
							<strong>*NIX:</strong>  On *NIX you'll need to do a: tar -zxvf jinzora-X.X.tar.gz (where X.X is the version number)
							to extract Jinzora to the current directory
							<br><br>
							<strong>Note</strong>: Jinzora WILL create a subdirectory called "jinzora2"
							<br><br><br><br>
						</td>						
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td width="40%" class="bodyBody" valign="top">
							<li><strong>Preparing</strong></li>
						</td>
						<td width="60%" class="bodyBody">
							<strong>Windows Users:</strong> You MUST make sure that the Jinzora directory from above is 
							located with in your webserver's root directory (c:\inetpub\www by default). <br>
							<br>
							You also need to make sure that the webserver has at least read access to the directory you've extracted
							Jinzora to (which it should unless you've changed things...)
							<br><br>
							<strong>*NIX Users:</strong> To make installing Jinzora on *NIX easier (and for those that have SSH access) 
							we've provided a script that will setup everything for Jinzora's installation.  Please simply run:<br><br>
							sh configure.sh
							<br><br>
							Inside the Jinzora directory.  This will create the necessary files and setup the proper permissions so the
							web based portion of the installation can complete (if you don't have SSH access don't worry, see 
							<a href="ftp-only.html" target="Body">FTP Only</a>	installation for assistance)

							To take advantage of the image resizing functions in Jinzora you'll need the 
							<a href="http://www.boutell.com/gd/" target="_blank">Boutell.com GD image libraries</a>.
							To install these (these are ROUGH guidelines)
							<br><br>
							<strong>Windows Users:</strong> 
							<br>
							1. Download the GD Library <a href="http://www.jinzora.org/modules.php?op=modload&name=Downloads&file=index&req=viewdownload&cid=4" target="_blank">from us</a> (or get it on the net...)<br><br>
							2. Unzip it to the exact same directory where PHP is installed (c:\php)<br><br>
							3. Edit php.ini (usually in c:\winnt or c:\windows) and edit the following line:<br>
							   extension=php_gd2.dll (REMOVE the ; at the beginning of the line)
							<br><br>
							<strong>*NIX Users:</strong> This can be a bit more complicated on *NIX, so we recommend you view the installation guide
							located at <a href="http://www.boutell.com/gd/" target="_blank">Boutell.com</a> for assistance

							Now that you've gotten everything ready, browse (in your favorite web browser) to<br><br>
							http://yoursite/path/to/jinzora/index.php<br><br>
							And you'll be taken through the web based installer.  The web based installer is fully documented and should
							describe each option that you'll have along the way.
							<br><br>At the very end the installer you'll be given the option to submit anonymous stats about your
							Jinzora installation.  We hope you'll submit these stats so that we can do our best to make
							Jinzora as powerful as possible.  We do not collect any personal or user specific information
							of any kind at this step.
