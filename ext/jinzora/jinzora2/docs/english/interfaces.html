				<strong>Jinzora Interfaces</strong>
				<br><br>
				One of the most powerful features of Jinzora is it's ability to support multiple
				"interfaces" or "skins".  Interfaces can be designed for specific purposes or to
				extend the functionality of Jinzora.<br><br>
				There are several interfaces included with Jinzora and many more will come in the future.
				We will also be adding a interface design guide in the future, please check the 
				<a href="http://www.jinzora.com/pages.php?pn=developers">Developer section</a> of Jinzora.com
				for more details.
