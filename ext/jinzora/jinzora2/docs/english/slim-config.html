				<strong>Configuring Slimzora</strong><br>
				<br>
				Slimzora is rather easy to configure.  By default it will take many settings from your settings.php
				file, and there are several things that are set by default to make Slimzora work a little more smoothly.
				<br><br>
				If you want to over ride these settings you can either modify slim.html or you can create:
				<br><br>
				slim.prefs.html
				and put the settings in there.  The file needs to be a standard PHP file so it should start with
				<br><br>
				&lt;?php
				<br><br>
				and end with
				<br><br>
				?&gt
				<br><br>
				See "slim.html" for all the possible settings that can go in this file.  Why would you want to create this file
				when you can just edit "slim.html"?  Well because when you upgrade "slim.html" will be over written, but the "slim.prefs.html" 
				file won't!
