				<strong>Jukebox Install</strong>
				<br><br>
				You can use Jinzora's Jukebox mode to play media on the Jinzora server rather than
				stream it to another computer.  This allows you to put a computer with your home stereo
				and control meida playback to it using Jinzora.<br>
				<br>
				The currently supported Jukebox interfaces are:<br>
				<li>MPD (Music Player Daemon) on *NIX platforms</li>
				<li>Winamp (with the httpQ plugin) on Windows platforms</li>
				<li>SlimServer by <a href="http://www.slimdevices.com" target="_blank">SlimDevices</a> - a hardware device</li>
				<li>The Turtle Beach Audiotron - a hardware device</li>
				<br>
				It is assumed that the jukebox interface you are planning on using is already working before proceeding.
				Please ensure that either MPD, Winamp (with httpQ), SlimServer, or your Audiotron can play media just fine before
				using the guide below.
				<br><br>
				<strong>Setting up Jukebox Mode</strong><br>
				<br>
				<li>Make sure Jinzora is up and running fully before beginning</li><br>
				<li>Edit the Jinzora settings.php file and set $jukebox = "true";</li><br>
				<li>Refresh your Jinzora interface.  You should now have a "Jukebox bar".  You'll now
				need to edit settings.php in the Jinzora "jukebox" directory (not the root one).<br><br>
				<li>This file is documented internally.  Please copy the section you plan on using into the
				section above.  Ensure that all the settings you use here match the settings for your player.<br><br>
				<br>
				That should do it.  Refresh Jinzora and play some media, Jinzora should now be controlling your media
				player of choice and your Jukebox should be complete.
