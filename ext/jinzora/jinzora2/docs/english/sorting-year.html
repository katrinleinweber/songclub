				<strong>Sorting By Year</strong>
				<br><br>
				If you like, you can have Jinzora sort your albums by the year they were released, if that
				information if available in the meta tag in the files in the album folder (usually the ID3 year
				tag).  Jinzora will read the first file that it finds year information for withing each album
				folder and use that data to display the year information.  Jinzora will then sort the
				albums by year, with any albums that do not have year information appearing after this in
				alphabetical order.
				<br><br>
				You can however have Jinzora always sort by album title.  The variable for this is:
				<br><br>
				<strong>$sort_by_year</strong>
				<br><br><br><br>
