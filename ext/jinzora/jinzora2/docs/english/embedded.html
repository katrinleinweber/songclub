				<strong>Using the Embedded Media Players</strong><br>
				<br>
				Jinzora supports a very powerful embedded player system.  What this means is that when the user selects media
				to play it does not stream to a local client, but rather opens a popup window with an embedded player to play the music.  The
				goal of this system is to make it much more difficult for users to gain access to your media without your permission while
				still allowing them to play media.  There are currently 4 supported players supporting different media and options.  They are:
				<br><br>
				<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>xspf</strong> (XSPF Player)<br>

					<strong>*</strong> Simple but elegant interface<br>
					<strong>*</strong> Flash Based for great compatibility<br>

				<li>
					<strong>wimpy</strong> (Wimpy Flash Based Player)<br>
