				<strong>Configuring Jinzora</strong><br>
				<br>
				Jinzora includes a web based configuration system.  This can be accessed via the "Tools"
				menu within Jinzora (you must be logged in as an admin).
				<br><br>
				The configuration system allows you to change almost all aspects of Jinzora (pretty much everything
				except the jukebox configuration).  You'll need to ensure that your settings file is writeable by the
				webserver in order for this feature to work.  The configuration system is very self explanatory.<br>
