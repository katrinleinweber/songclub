				<strong>Bulk Editing Media</strong><br>
				<br>
				There are a couple of tools that can be used to bulk edit media within Jinzora.  These can be accessed from the
				"Media Management" menu when logged in with admin privledeges (most of these are accessable on the "Tracks" page).  They are:

							<strong>Retag All Tracks</strong><br>
							This tells Jinzora to dynamically rewrite the ID3 tags on the tracks based on the filesystem data.  It will also,
							if present, write the album art directly to the ID3 tag (so when the track is streamed the album art can be viewed).
							<br><br>
							When writing the tags the filesystem data is used.  For example in "Genre" mode (or 3 directory mode) the following file
							would be written the following way:
							<br><br>
							/Jazz/Miles Davis/Kind of Blue/07 - All Blues.mp3
							<br><br>
							Genre: Jazz<br>
							Artist: Miles Davis<br>
							Album: Kind of Blue<br>
							Track Name: All Blues<br>
							Track Number: 07<br>
							<br><br><br><br>

						<td width="100%" class="bodyBody" valign="top">
							<strong>Renumber Tracks</strong><br>
							This will tell Jinzora to use it's meta data retrival functions to attempt to renumber tracks for an album.
							<br><br><br><br>
						</td>

					<tr>
						<td width="100%" class="bodyBody" valign="top">
							<strong>Search & Replace</strong><br>
							This will also you to edit the names of tracks and bulk remove information.  Say
							each track has the artist name in it, and you'd like to clean it up by removing that.
							<br><br>
							<strong>Fix Filename Case</strong> - This will change a track name from:<br><br>
							07 - all blues.mp3
							<br><br>
							to
							<br><br>
							07 - All Blues.mp3
							<br><br>
							So it will display prettier.

							<strong>Create Clips | Delete Clips</strong><br>
							This allows you to bulk create "clip" tracks from all the tracks in an album.  This will create
							a songname.clip.mp3 file using approximately 30 seconds of data starting 30 seconds into the track.
							<br><br><br><br>

						<td width="100%" class="bodyBody" valign="top">
							<strong>Create LoFi Tracks | Delete LoFi Tracks</strong><br>
							This allows you to create pre-resampled tracks (using lame) for streaming from Jinzora.
							Using this tool you can pre-create these tracks to they do not have to be resampled on the fly.
