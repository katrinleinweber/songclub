				<strong>Jinzora Suggests</strong>
				<br><br>
				One of the Groupware features of Jinzora is Jinzora Suggestions.  This allows Jinzora
				to suggest tracks to users based on their common ratings.

							There are a few things you'll need to do to enable Jinzora Suggestions.  You can choose the
							"workgroup" install type during installation, which will set the proper options, or make sure 
							that:<br><br>
							$enable_suggestions = "true";
							<br><br>
							In your settings.php file.
							<br><br>
							You'll also need to make sure that you've created the "data" directory (under the 
							root directory of Jinzora) and that the webserver user has write access to this directory.
							This directory stores all the data files that are needed for discussions.
							<br><br>
							You can set how many tracks Jinzora will suggest for a user by settings:
							<br><br>
							<strong>$num_most_played = "5";</strong>
							<br><br>
							That would tell Jinzora to display 5 suggestions to each user.
