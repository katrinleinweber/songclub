				<strong>Request Counting</strong>
				<br><br>
				One of the Groupware features of Jinzora is request counting.  This allows Jinzora
				to track how many times a track has been requested from Jinzora.
				<br><br>
				<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0">

							<strong>Enabling</strong>
						</td>
						<td width="70%" class="bodyBody">
							There are a few things you'll need to do to enable request counting.  You can choose the
							"workgroup" install type during installation, which will set the proper options, or make sure 
							that:<br><br>
							$track_plays = "true";
							<br><br>
							In your settings.php file.
							<br><br>
							You'll also need to make sure that you've created the "data" directory (under the 
							root directory of Jinzora) and that the webserver user has write access to this directory.
							This directory stores all the data files that are needed for discussions.
							<br><br>
							You can also have Jinzora display the top 5 requested tracks on the home page by setting this
							in settings.php:
							<br><br>
							$num_most_played = "5";
							<br><br>
							That would tell Jinzora to display the top 5 most requested tracks on the home page
